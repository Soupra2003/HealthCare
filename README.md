# HealthCare
## Project Overview
Processed and cleaned healthcare datasets using Excel and Power Query to transform raw data for accurate analysis. Created interactive dashboards in Power BI (Bar chart, donut chart, Funnel chart, Line chart etc.) to track patient demographics, disease wise patients count, and Bed Occupancy, Insurance vs Billing amount per patients. Based on the data analysis, I conclude that around 90% of the billing amount is covered by insurance, reducing the financial burden on patients.
